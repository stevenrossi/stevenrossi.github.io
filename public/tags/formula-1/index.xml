    <description><![CDATA[My goal with this project was to develop a Formula 1 visualizer that analysed relatively basic data over a broad time scale, without getting into the more detailed data (e.g., lap-specific times, telemetry) that has become more readily available in recent years.
In Formula 1 there are well known difficulties in comparing the relative performance of drivers given that drivers compete in machinery of varying quality, i.e., did driver A finish ahead of driver B because he is a better driver or because he was driving a faster car?]]></description>
