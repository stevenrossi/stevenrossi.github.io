One of the biggest stories in football this year has been the growth of the Saudi Professional League (SPL). Though the SPL was widely expected to grow following Cristiano Ronaldo's signing for the Riyadh-based Al-Nassr FC at the end of last year, most observers have been caught off guard by the aggressiveness of Saudi clubs in this summer's transfer window.

In some cases, the free-spending nature of Saudi clubs has helped the European clubs shed high-earning players who are past their prime and would be otherwise difficult to transfer due to their high wages (e.g., Neymar, or any of the players prised from Chelsea). However, Jeddah-based Al-Ahli SFC beat top clubs in England and Italy to the signature of 21-year old Spanish midfielder Gabri Veiga, demonstrating the ability of Saudi clubs to also poach young talent, albeit at astronomical costs (Al-Ahli were willing to pay a higher transfer fee than the European clubs, while Veiga's salary at Al-Ahli will be nearly 6 times higher than the salary offered to him by Napoli).

Comparisons have been made between the Saudi football transfer raid of 2023 and the short-lived emergence of the Chinese Super League in 2015-2016, in which Chinese clubs spent big on aging stars while also signing some players still desired by Europe's top clubs, such as Jackson Martinez. Of course, the Chinese Super League fell from prominance even faster than it emerged, as steep taxes on foreign transfers were imposed to stem the tide of capital flowing out of China. There is little worry of similar events unfolding in Saudi Arabia, so many are anticipating that the Saudi league is here to stay in a way the Chinese league was not.

We note that this analysis only includes expenditures and income related to transfers and not to salaries. This is important, since many of the biggest "transfers" were free signings (e.g., Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante) and since star players earn significantly higher salaries in the Saudi League than they would in Europe.
